        I remember when I first arrived in the United States. <br>
        Even before the plane landed, the little windows <br>
        in the airplane revealed snow and ice-covered houses <br>
        and buildings. As I walked off the plane, cold air <br>
        crept through the corrugated ramp that led to the <br>
        airport terminal. Some people inside the airport were <br>
        wearing big coats and hats, which I had seen on television, <br>
        but never up close. I felt a little dizzy and needed to sit <br>
        down, and then my cell phone rang. It was my Aunt Sophia. <br>
        She was waiting for me outside in the passenger pick-up
