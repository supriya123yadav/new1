<!-- HTML5 features include native audio and video support without the need for Flash.

The HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags make it simple to add media to a website. You need to set src attribute to identify the media source and include a controls attribute so the user can play and pause the media.
    
The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which video formats browsers should support in the video tag. But most commonly used video formats are −

Ogg − Ogg files with Thedora video codec and Vorbis audio codec.

mpeg4 − MPEG4 files with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.



To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t support in Safari browser. 

Syntax

<video>
    <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
</video>
